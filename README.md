<h1>Overview</h1>
Before cloning and using this code please read the get started information <a href="https://rpx-100.net/getstarted.html">here.</a><br><br>

Development and operation of an emergency radio communication system is a newly enforced duty of the Radio Amateurs in Austria and reason for the need to establish a new digital transmission procedure allowing high speed data communication in Sub-GHz Frequency bands.<br><br>
Requirements for the new communication system are to use a wideband transmission mode to support more bandwidth for each user, and enables multiple users at the same time to connect to a base station.
The implementation of a new digital communication system will be based on the concept of a software defined radio using the LimeSDR ecosystem. This will address and motivate a larger community of developers and radio amateurs to get involved in the enhancement of the system. 
Hardware and software design of a base station and CPE-like user device shall allow a modular use with different radio front-ends supporting all possible Sub-GHz frequency bands.<br><br>
The Austrian Radio Amateur Association (OeVSV) together with the Institute of Telecommunication of the Vienna University of Technology will request a permit to test operation of such a new digital communication system in VHF and UHF frequency bands. A possible cooperation with The German Radio Amateur Association shall be explored for utilizing the new transmission protocol in German UHF bands.

<h1>Goals</h1>
<ul>
<li>Evaluate and select appropriate wireless communication protocol similar to existing Wireless LAN protocols but suitable for the VHF and UHF bands.</li>
<li>Define a new transmission protocol for wideband data communication for efficient use of the a 2Mhz spectrum in the VHF band and suitable to operate an emergency data communication network connecting end-user devices to base stations.</li>
<li>Software development and implementation of the transmission protocol on a prototype SRD hardware for a base station and end users devices using the GNU Radio ecosystem.</li>
<li>Test and evaluation the new transmission protocol in lab- and field environments on selected Radio Amateur Relay locations in Austria.</li>
<li>Benchmark how reliability and scalability such a new transmission protocol can be operated in the VHF and UHF band.</li>
<li>Provide a blueprint for industrial development and production of base stations and end-user devices for the new transmission protocol.</li>
</ul>
